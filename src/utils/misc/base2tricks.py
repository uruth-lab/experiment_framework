    # This uses two facts:
    # 1 - If the number is a power of two, then only 1 bit will be set in its
    #   binary representation.
    # 2 - If we subtract 1 from a number which is power of 2,
    #   then all the bits after the set-bit (there is only one set bit as per
    #   point-1) will become set and the set bit will be unset. i.e:
